                        <p>"I would like to send you my appreciation for designing, resourcing and overseeing the fitting of the oak cupboards and shelving units in our boys bedrooms. They really are fantastic, and exactly what we wanted, utilising the difficult space under the eaves of the boy’s rooms. Please also pass on our thanks to Steve, your very talented fitter. He was very thorough in fitting the units, especially when he was challenged with the uneven beams.
We now have some stunning bedroom furniture, which everyone admires, I will be passing on your details to friends and family."</p>

                        <p>"Dear ACS
as you well know, I have been using Antony & his team for some time now for all of my installations. I’ve nothing but praise for Antony’s project management, and the team of professionals he has put together to execute jobs to a very high standard. It is a huge help to me to be able to hand over to Antony when we start, freeing up my time to move the business forwards. We keep in touch regularly during jobs, and he will always inform me of anything that needs sorting.

The projects we undertake often involve building work, electrics, plastering, electrical, as well as the actual kitchen installation – all of which Antony deals with impeccably. My clients always comment on the teams professionalism and this means a lot to me and my valued clients. I couldnt really ask for much more!"</p>
