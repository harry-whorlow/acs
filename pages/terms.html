                    Management sends you confirmation by email to this effect,
                    regardless of whether you receive it or not, but only to the
                    condition that ACS Project Management may subsequently not
                    be able to deliver the items or service, or may decide on
                    reasonable grounds not to do so. Such reasons may include
                    (but are not limited to) safety concerns, product
                    availability, or for the reason that the product ordered has
                    been listed for sale at an incorrect price due to
                    typographical error or other error in pricing information.
                    In any event, please check the details in our confirmation
                    email on receipt and notify us immediately if any amendments
                    need to be made.

                    at any time prior to acceptance, to refuse any order or any
                    part of an order, or to require further and better
                    information to enable it to evaluate and/or process the
                    order. Without prejudice to the statutory rights afforded to
                    consumers under English law, ACS Project Management accepts
                    no liability for any failure to deliver product or service
                    where this results from its inability to do so or its
                    decision on reasonable grounds not to do so, provided that
                    it takes all reasonable steps to notify you within 14 days
                    of order placement that products will not be shipped as
                    ordered. In such cases, ACS Project Management will not
                    process any payment or will immediately refund any payment
                    made in full.

                    from ACS Project Management giving sufficient lead time to

                <h4>Taxes:</h4>
                <p>
                    If you are a resident of the European Union, VAT at current
                    rate will be added to any commission and is already present
                    when applying product to ‘The ACS FLOOR STORE’ for payment.
                    If you are a non-EU resident, VAT will not be charged.
                </p>
                <h4>Damages:</h4>
                <p>
                    You must notify us of any shortages, damages, defect in
                    quality or conditions of the product or failure of the
                    product to correspond with the specification within a
                    reasonable period of time. We would normally expect to
                    receive such response within (3) days of the date of
                    delivery or installation where the defect or failure was not
                    apparent or by reasonable inspection, within (3) days after
                    discovery of the defect or failure. Failure to notify us
                    within the reasonable time period will result in the loss of
                    your right to reject the goods and your right to have any
                    defects remedied subject to our absolute discretion. As the
                    products supplied are not manufactured by ACS Project
                    Management, you are not entitled to reject a product for
                    reasons other than those set out above. All returns are
                    subject to a 10% re-stocking charge. Your statutory rights
                    are not or will not be affected.
                </p>

                    Errors in the event a product or service is listed at an
                    incorrect price due to typographical error or error in
                    pricing information, ACS Project Management shall have the
                    right without any liability whatsoever to refuse or cancel
                    any orders placed for product listed at the incorrect price.
                    ACS Project Management shall have the right to refuse or
                    cancel any such orders whether or not the order has been
                    confirmed and your credit card or Paypal account charged. If
                    your credit card or Paypal account has already been charged
                    for the purchase and your order has been cancelled, ACS
                    Project Management shall issue a credit to your credit card
                    or Paypal account to the amount of the incorrect price.

                <p>
                    2.1 You order and agree to buy, and we agree to sell, the
                    Goods at the Price, subject to these terms and
                    conditions.<br />

                </p>
                <h4>Applicable terms, conditions and representations:</h4>
                <p>
                    3.1 These terms are the express terms and conditions
                    governing the Agreement.<br />
                    3.2 There cannot be a variation or change to anything in
                    this Agreement unless it is agreed in writing and signed by
                    both of us.<br />
                    3.3 It is your responsibility to check that all the details
                    relating to your order are correct and to provide us with
                    all relevant information relating to the environment in
                    which the Goods are intended to be used and for their
                    Delivery.<br />
                    3.4 It is important that you check your measurements
                    carefully. An order should always include an additional 10%
                    to allow for wastage to cover cutting, minor imperfections,
                    as could be expected with the type of stone and finish
                    ordered, and breakage. If you do not order enough,
                    subsequent Goods (as they are a naturally occurring product)
                    may not be exactly the same as the original Goods.<br />
                    3.5 We can provide estimates of quantities of Goods but this
                    will be based on general guidelines and the measurements
                    which you have supplied. It is your responsibility to
                    provide accurate measurements to ensure that the correct
                    quantities of Goods are ordered. You should therefore seek
                    professional advice as variations in surfaces and angles may
                    affect the quantities required. We will not be responsible
                    for any shortfalls or surpluses.<br />
                    3.6 Where you are acting other than as a consumer, you
                    confirm that you are not entering into this Agreement on the
                    basis of, or relying on, any representation made to you by
                    us that is not expressly incorporated into this Agreement in
                    writing and signed by both of us.<br />
                    3.7 As we have not carried out a survey or inspection of the
                    installation site of the Goods, we cannot give any warranty
                    as to the suitability of the Goods for that, or any other
                    given environment. If you are acting other than as a
                    consumer, you cannot rely on any implied or express
                    representation, advice or information given to you by us
                    that is not incorporated into the Agreement and signed by
                    both of us.<br />
                    3.8 We cannot be held responsible for circumstances beyond
                    our reasonable control. This may include (without
                    limitation) shortfalls at source, natural disasters and
                    restraints or delays affecting suppliers or transportation
                    to us. We will endeavour to notify you as soon as possible
                    should these problems occur.<br />
                    3.9 In the case of Business Sales, you confirm that these
                    are the only terms of the agreement between us and any
                    provisions upon which you purport to purchase including
                    those on any of your purchase order, or confirmation of
                    order or similar documents or forms do not apply to this
                    agreement between us.
                </p>
                <h4>Description and samples:</h4>
                <p>
                    4.1 All descriptions, images (in both print and on the
                    internet) and samples of our Goods are for the purpose of
                    giving an approximate representation of the Goods only.<br />
                    4.2 You acknowledge that the Goods are natural and
                    geological variations will occur in terms of colour,
                    markings, texture, size and between consignments, which are
                    beyond our control. We advise you to view as much of the
                    Goods as possible before entering into this Agreement.<br />
                    4.3 You should be aware that all of the Goods are porous to
                    some degree and should be sealed. Some may easily be
                    scratched and/or be subject to natural pitting/chipping.
                </p>
                <h4>Sales:</h4>
                <p>
                    5.1 The Price is the price indicated as exclusive of any
                    value added tax, and delivery charge, which you must pay in
                    addition.
                </p>
                <p>
                    5.2 We reserve the right to change the Price by giving you
                    notice at any time before delivery to reflect any increase
                    in the cost to us such as foreign exchange fluctuations,
                    alteration of duties, increase of the costs of materials and
                    such like. If we change the Price and you are not happy with
                    it, you will be able to cancel your order. Products which
                    are not standard and are therefore specifically ordered for
                    you or are fabricated for you cannot be cancelled after the
                    order/fabrication process has started. If we do agree to
                    cancel the order, you will be liable for any reasonable
                    costs incurred.
                </p>
                <h4>Payment:</h4>
                <p>
                    6.1 Payment is required on placement of your order. Please
                    note that we will not arrange delivery until we are in
                    receipt of cleared funds.
                </p>
                <h4>Delivery &#038; Collection:</h4>
                <p>
                    7.0 Orders requiring next day delivery need to be placed
                    before 11am in order to allow for sufficient processing
                    time.<br />
                    7.1 We shall endeavour to have the Goods delivered to the
                    Delivery Address on the Delivery Date, but time for delivery
                    is not of the essence of this Agreement. We often use an
                    independent delivery company for which we are not
                    responsible so we cannot guarantee delivery times.<br />
                    7.2 The Goods will be off-loaded at the nearest accessible
                    point to the Delivery Address at the discretion of the
                    driver, which may be the kerb side. The driver will not
                    handle the Goods further.<br />
                    7.3 You must make us aware of any access restrictions or
                    difficulties for a large lorry and you must ensure a
                    responsible person is at the Delivery Address at the time of
                    Delivery to supervise the off-load and sign for the
                    Goods.<br />
                    7.4 The cost of delivery is in addition to the Price and
                    subject to VAT.<br />
                    7.5 If we are not able to deliver the Goods as a result of
                    you not complying with your obligations under these terms,
                    the Goods will be retained by the driver and you will be
                    responsible for any re-delivery or storage charges. Delivery
                    charges in any circumstance are non re-fundable.<br />
                    7.6 You may only collect your Goods by arrangement and only
                    in a vehicle capable of being fork-lift loaded (unless
                    otherwise agreed in writing). If you arrange transportation
                    of the Goods, it is at your own risk and we will not accept
                    claims for damage or breakages. Collection will be charged
                    at the same price as delivery.<br />
                    7.7 Arrangements can be made for an order to be picked and
                    held for up to 8 weeks from order confirmation, allowing a
                    customer to select a delivery date (this service is charged
                    at our 2-3 day delivery rate)
                </p>
                <h4>Risk and Property:</h4>
                <p>
                    8.1 The risk of, for example, breakage, loss and damage in
                    the Goods will pass from us to you on completion of delivery
                    or, if you decide to collect the Goods, at the point of
                    collection.<br />
                    8.2 The ownership of the Goods will not pass to you until we
                    have received payment of the Total Price in full in cleared
                    funds.
                </p>
                <h4>Unpacking, stacking and storing: ></h4>
                <p>
                    9.1 Care needs to be taken when unpacking the Goods as the
                    spacers may need to be removed from the packaging before the
                    Goods are lifted out. The Goods should always be stacked and
                    stored vertically (on edge) but not on a hard surface as
                    this may cause unnecessary edge chipping. We cannot be held
                    responsible for damage which occurs after delivery or, if
                    you decide to collect the Goods, after collection.<br />
                    9.2 Stone tiles may need to dry out before the installation
                    process begins. You should ask your fitter to advise you if
                    this is the case.
                </p>
                <h4>Examination and Acceptance:</h4>
                <p>
                    10.1 We take care to ensure that all of our Goods leave us
                    in perfect condition. If there is any obvious damage to the
                    Goods, please make a note of the damage on the delivery
                    note. If the Goods are deemed and proven to be damaged on
                    delivery, by way of documentary evidence such as a
                    photograph, we will bear the cost of re –delivery and
                    replacement Goods. Please note that you will still be
                    required to notify us under clause 10.2 and 10.3 (as
                    applicable).
                </p>
                <h4>Consumer Sales:</h4>
                <p>
                    10.2 If the Goods are not of the correct type or damaged,
                    you should notify us as soon as possible (within 3 days) and
                    we will either refund to you the Total Price or make
                    available replacement Goods (at your option). If the fault
                    with the order proves to be an error on our part, we will
                    bear the cost of redelivery of replacement Goods and
                    collection of the original Goods. If the fault with the
                    order proves to be an error on your part, you will be
                    required to bear the cost of redelivery of replacement Goods
                    and collection of the original Goods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    10.3 If an incorrect amount of the Goods are delivered or
                    collected, you should notify us as soon as possible (within
                    3 days) and we will arrange to deliver or make available (as
                    appropriate) the correct quantity of the Goods. If this
                    proves to be an error on our part, we will bear the cost of
                    delivery of the balance of the order. If this proves to be
                    an error on your part, you will bear the cost of delivery of
                    the balance of the order.
                </p>
                <h4>Limitation of Liability:</h4>
                <p>
                    11.4 We will be liable for your losses arising out of the
                    provision by us of a shortfall in, or defective or damaged
                    Goods to the extent that such losses are reasonably
                    foreseeable. However, we will not be liable to you for lost
                    working time or the cost of third party contractors where
                    you (or your contractor) fail to install the Goods correctly
                    or fail to use the correct base, sealants or installation
                    techniques or if the environment in which the Goods are
                    installed is unsuitable.<br />
                    11.5 Please note that we sometimes provide extra and/or
                    damaged extra tiles to you free of charge with your order,
                    which may be of use to you. We will therefore only be liable
                    to you if we have not provided you with the quantity of
                    Goods which you ordered in a non-defective and undamaged
                    condition.<br />
                    11.6 Nothing in this Agreement is intended to limit any
                    rights that you may have as a consumer under statute or to
                    limit our liability to you in respect of death or personal
                    injury resulting from our negligence or for fraud or
                    fraudulent misrepresentation in respect of an untrue or
                    misleading statement.
                </p>
                <h4>Right of Cancelation:</h4>
                <p>
                    This clause only applies if you are acting for a purpose
                    outside your business and there has been a distance
                    contract.<br />
                    Distance Contract means any contract concerning goods or
                    services between a supplier and a consumer under a distance
                    sales or service provision scheme that makes exclusive use
                    of distance communication up to and including the moment at
                    which a contract is made.<br />
                    12.1 You may cancel this Agreement within 3 working days
                    (period of cancellation) beginning the day after you receive
                    the Goods.<br />
                    12.2 To cancel you must let us know in writing that you wish
                    to cancel. You may do this by letter, fax or email sent
                    within the 3 days to us at the address set out in clause 1.
                    If you tell us verbally you will need to send confirmation
                    in writing within the 3 days.<br />
                    12.3 You cannot cancel if the Goods are made specifically
                    for you, or you have installed or laid them or used them.<br />
                    12.4 If you wish to cancel Goods which have already been
                    delivered, then you must return the Goods to us at your own
                    cost, or we can collect them from you. If we collect the
                    goods, then you will be liable for the cost of
                    collection.<br />
                    12.5 You have a duty of care during the period of
                    cancellation to ensure that the goods are returned to us in
                    the condition in which they were delivered. We reserve the
                    right to charge for any damages caused by failure to carry
                    out your duty of care.
                </p>
                <h4>Fixing Products and Installation:</h4>
                <p>
                    13.1 Any advice given by us or our staff relating to fixing
                    products and installation is given in good faith but should
                    be used as a general guide only as we have not carried out a
                    survey of the place of installation of the Goods and cannot
                    therefore be sure that our advice is correct. It is your
                    responsibility to purchase the correct fixing products and
                    sealants for the environment in which (and in particular the
                    surface upon which) the Goods will be installed. We
                    recommend that you take advice from a professional
                    fitter.<br />
                    13.2 It is your responsibility to ensure a professional
                    fitter is carrying out your installation. We strongly
                    recommend that you take up independent references.<br />
                    13.3 We cannot therefore be responsible for the manner of
                    installation (unless commissioned by us) of the Goods or for
                    damage caused during or arising out of installation.
                </p>
                <h4>Third Parties:</h4>
                <p>
                    This Agreement is not intended to and does not give any
                    third parties any right to enforce any of its provisions.
